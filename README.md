[Newton-Raphson method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method)<br><br>
Newton's method, also called the Newton-Raphson method, is a root-finding algorithm that uses the first few terms of the Taylor series of a function f(x) in the vicinity of a suspected root. Newton's method is sometimes also known as Newton's iteration, although in this work the latter term is reserved to the application of Newton's method for computing square roots.

[Secant method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method)<br><br>
In numerical analysis, the secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function f. The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method. However, the method was developed independently of Newton's method and predates it by over 3000 years.

[Bisection method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)<br><br>
In mathematics, the bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow.
